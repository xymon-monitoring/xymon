Xymon Code of Conduct
====================

Like the technical community as a whole, the Xymon community is made up of professionals and volunteers from around the world, contributing across development, maintenance, support, and knowledge sharing.

Diversity is a strength, but it can also lead to misunderstandings. This Code of Conduct defines baseline expectations to ensure a respectful, productive, and inclusive environment for everyone involved in the project.

This document is not an exhaustive list of prohibited behavior. It is intended as a practical guide for constructive participation.

Scope
-----

This Code of Conduct applies to all communication spaces, platforms, and activities managed or operated by the Xymon project, whether online or in person.

Behavior outside these spaces may also affect an individual’s ability to participate within them.

Violations should be reported by email to:

- xymon@xymon.com

Standards of Behavior
---------------------

All participants are expected to follow these principles:

- Be friendly and patient.
  Assume good intent and allow room for learning and mistakes.

- Be welcoming.
  Participation is open to anyone who engages constructively and respectfully.

- Be considerate.
  Your actions and decisions affect others and the long-term health of the project. Keep in mind that this is a global community and that communication styles may differ.

- Be respectful.
  Disagreement is normal and can be productive. Disrespect, hostility, or personal attacks are not acceptable.

- Maintain professional conduct.
  Any behavior that undermines personal safety, dignity, or the ability of others to participate constructively is not acceptable.

- Resolve disagreements constructively.
  Focus on facts and shared goals. Seek to understand differing viewpoints and work toward solutions rather than assigning blame.
