# INSTALLSTATICWWWDIR installs the web content Xymon ships -- gifs, help,
# menu -- apart from what xymongen and the CGIs write, and links it back.
#
# Three installs into scratch trees, every install path inside them and owned
# by the user running the test (a staged INSTALLROOT install does not do: its
# symlinks point outside the stage, and the install's chown follows them):
#
#   - unset: gifs, help and menu are real directories in the www tree, as
#     they always were;
#   - set: the content is in the static directory, the www tree holds
#     symlinks to it, and the directories xymongen writes stay real;
#   - a standalone "make install-docs" with it set still links www/help,
#     which the help links on the web pages are read through;
#   - "make -C xymond" and "make -C docs" alone, without the top-level
#     Makefile that sets the default, install into the www tree too, not at
#     the root of the install. This one is staged under INSTALLROOT, so a
#     regression lands in the stage rather than in /.
