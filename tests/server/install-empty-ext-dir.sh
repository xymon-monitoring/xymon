#
# xymond's install-cfg completes when the ext/ directory is empty.
#
# install-cfg gave ext/ to XYMONUSER with "chown ... $(INSTALLEXTDIR)/*". The
# only file installed there is xymonnet's xymonnet-again.sh, so on a server
# built without xymonnet ext/ is empty: the glob matched nothing, reached chown
# as the literal path ".../ext/*", and the install failed with "cannot access".
#
# Installed for real into a scratch tree, every install path pointed inside it
# and owned by the user running the test. A staged install (INSTALLROOT) does
# not do here: its symlinks point at the final paths, outside the stage, and
# chown follows them. The full install puts xymonnet-again.sh in ext/; the
# test then empties ext/ and runs install-cfg again, which is the state a
# server without xymonnet installs in.
#
# The full install is a packager's one (PKGBUILD=1): without it, install-bin
# chowns the programs in the build tree, which fails for a user who does not
# own them -- after a "make install" as root, say. Only install-cfg, the step
# under test, runs its chowns, and they touch nothing outside the scratch tree.
