PROJECT-ORGANIZATION.md
=======================

Status: Draft

The next chapter provides an overview of the project.
It does not define the project exhaustively, but explains its main philosophy.

Who owns the project?
--------------------

Xymon is a community-driven project.
It has no single owner.

The project is collectively maintained by its contributors
under the terms of its license and the roles and responsibilities
described in this repository.

What roles exist in the project?
-------------------------------

The project uses four practical roles implied by the GitHub platform
and its permission model:
Owner, Maintainer, Contributor (Internal), and Contributor (External).

Roles clarify responsibilities and expectations
within the scope of the GitHub platform.
They do not define hierarchy or authority over project direction.

What are GitHub Owners?
----------------------

Main skill: Security

Owners are responsible for the integrity, security, and continuity
of the project’s hosting environment on the GitHub platform.

This includes ultimate accountability for:
- organization and repository administration,
- access control and membership,
- security-sensitive configuration and data.

What are Maintainers?
--------------------

Main skill: C code quality

Maintainers are responsible for the technical consistency
and long-term maintainability of the project on the GitHub platform.

This includes:
- deciding what changes are accepted or rejected in repositories,
- ensuring coherence across the codebase over time.

What are Contributors (Internal)?
--------------------------------

Main skill: Autonomy

Internal Contributors are organization members trusted with autonomous execution
within an explicitly delegated scope on the GitHub platform.

This includes:
- working autonomously (without constant supervision, but not necessarily alone)
  on subjects not explicitly covered by another group.

What are Contributors (External)?
--------------------------------

Main skill: Contribution

External Contributors are contributors who are not members of the GitHub organization
and not assigned to any internal group.

This includes:
- submitting changes through pull requests,
- raising issues and participating in discussions,
- contributing ideas, documentation, or analysis.

Team size and composition
-------------------------

Any group exercising critical responsibilities on the GitHub platform
must remain viable.

As a general rule:
- at least 3 people are required for continuity,
- sensitive groups should not exceed 5 people to preserve effectiveness and trust.

How is project direction decided?
--------------------------------

Project direction emerges from open discussion
and from the work that is effectively carried out and maintained over time.

Where does governance happen?
-----------------------------

Governance takes place through the project’s regular collaboration channels
and is not exclusive to the GitHub platform.
There is no separate formal committee or governing body.

Can roles change over time?
--------------------------

Yes. Roles reflect actual involvement and availability
and will evolve as participation and responsibilities change.
