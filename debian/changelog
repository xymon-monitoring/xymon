   * Ensure we don't leave xymond_hostdata or xymond_history zombies lying around
     after dropping host records (Reported by Scot Kreienkamp)
   * Fix up HTML list layout to reflect current standards (Thanks, hallik@calyc3.com)

   * The signature algorithm used on an SSL-enabled TCP test run by xymonnet is now shown
     on the sslcert page. (Thanks, Ralph Mitchell)
   * The cipher list displayed in 'sslcert' tests will now be limited to the cipher that was 
     actually used on the SSL connection. The --showallciphers option to xymonnet will
     restore the previous behavior. (From idea from Ralph Mitchell)
   * Provide configurable environment overrides in xymonserver.cfg for standard xymonnet 
     options to fping/xymonping, ntpdate, and traceroute binaries. In regular installs, the   
     intended default options to traceroute (-n -q 2 -w 2 -m 15) were not actually used. This
     may change in a future release, so it's suggested that users move any custom options to    
     the new TRACEROUTEOPTS setting in xymonserver.cfg.

   * Fix COMPACT parsing; update docs to match expected syntax (Thanks, Brian Scott)
   * Trailing slash no longer required for URL alias ("http://www.example.com/xymon" should work)
   * A new XYMONLOCALCLIENTOPTS variable in xymonclient.cfg allows options (e.g., --no-port-listing)
     to be given to xymond_client when running in local client mode.
   * Add a method to indicate lines which should be skipped by the NCV RRD processor or
     which mark the end of data-to-be-processed in the message.

xymon (4.3.20) unstable; urgency=medium

   * rev 7661

   * Summaries should be properly displayed again, and will display on the
     nongreen.html page as well.
   * An icon for green acknowledged states is now included -- ironically, the
     original icon that the other checkmarks were based off of.
   * The various utilities in cgi-bin and cgi-secure are now hardlinked to
     cgiwrap at install time instead of softlink, to allow for FollowSymLinks-less
     apache configurations
   * The protocol section of URLs in hosts.cfg is now case-insensitive, and ftps
     URLs (FTP-over-SSL, not sftp) are recognized as a protocol.
   * hosts.cfg docs have been clarified to include delayyellow and delayred as 
     allowable options (Reported by John Thurston)
   * 'optional include' and 'optional directory' syntax has been documented
   * pulldata directives in the hosts.cfg file now honor a given IP address and port
   * confreport.sh not displaying time-restricted alerts properly has been fixed
     (Reported by Gavin Stone-Tolcher)
   * Planned downtime settings are now applied to 'purple' statuses as well
     (Thanks, Torsten Richter)
   * Column documentation links should be working again (Reported by Andy Smith)
   * Fix missing null termination in certain logfetch situations (Reported by
     Johan Sj�berg)
   * New httphead tag to force an http request using HEAD instead of GET
   * Fix a memory leak introduced in parsing Windows SVCS test data
   * A divide-by-zero condition when systems erroneously report 0MB of physical
     memory has been corrected (Reported by John Thurston)
   * Parse either critical config or xymond-formatted acknowledgements on the
     report page, and add documentation for the --ack-log option in xymond
     (Thanks, Andy Smith)
   * The graphs to be displayed on a specific status page can be customized
     with environment variables - see xymonserver.cfg(5). From Werner Maier.
   * When clients are in "server" mode (sending raw data to the xymond server
     to be centrally processed), a 'clientlog' column will now be shown on
     xymon pages (similar to trends and info columns). This can be disabled on 
     a per-host basis by adding a 'noclient' tag to the hosts.cfg line, 
     or globally by adding that to the .default. host.
   * Add protocols.cfg entries for amqp(s), svn, ircd, and mail (submission).     
     (Note that smtp testing here may suffer the same occasional issue as  
     regular smtp conversations with regard to out-of-order commands.)
   * Fix a crash on non-glibc systems when testing xymond_alert configs with
     a host not in hosts.cfg (Reported by John Thurston)
   * On newer Linux kernels with recent procps-ng, use the "Available" memory
     reported by the kernel to give a more accurate reading for "Actual Used"
     in the client's memory status. (Reported by Dominique Frise)

xymon (4.3.19) unstable; urgency=medium

   * rev 7619
   
   * Don't crash when receiving an AAAA DNS response (BSD, thanks Mark Felder)
   * xymonclient.sh running in --local mode was generating reports that were
     marked as duplicates (and thus being ignored). Reported by Guillaume Chane.
   * Building with old versions of libpcre not supporting PCRE_FIRSTLINE should
     once again work
   * Memory reporting on FreeBSD and OpenBSD has been fixed (Mark Felder)
   * The process list visible in the 'procs' test of Linux and FreeBSD clients
     is now generated in ASCII "forest" mode for increased legibility.
   * clientlog, hostinfo, and modify messages are now tracked in xymond stats
   * In environment config files (xymonserver.cfg, xymonclient.cfg, and cfgoptions.cfg)
     an initial "export " line (as if it were actually a shell script) will be
     ignored and the remainder of the line parsed as normal.
   * headermatch will now match the headers of an HTTP response even if the body
     is empty (eg, matching for a 302 Redirect)
   * --debug mode in most daemons should cause *much* less of a performance hit, and
     output will be timestamped in microseconds
   * xymondboard can now be used to PCRE-match against the raw message, and 
     acknowledgement and disable comments. Inequalities can be specified against the 
     lastchange, logtime, validtime, acktime, disabletime fields (in epoch timestamps).
     The existing net= and tag= filters have been documented.
   * The sample xymon.conf apache snippet now supports apache 2.4 syntax
   * Fix missing newline when returning upcoming 'schedule' commands.
   * EXTIME= syntax in analysis.cfg and alerts.cfg has been added. This is applied
     after any TIME= filter. Use (e.g.) to exclude Wednesday afternoons on a line 
     which is already restricted to 9:00a to 5:00p on weekdays only.
   * The included version of c-ares has been bumped to version 1.10.0.
   * Support for older EGD (entropy gathering daemon) has been removed (Thanks, Bernard Spil)
   * A crash when xymond_rrd was run in --debug mode on non GNU/glibc systems has 
     been fixed
   * The msgs and procs tests are now HTML-encoded to ensure that lines with brackets
     are properly displayed
   * An acknowledgements.sh log report has been added in (Submitted by Andy Smith)
   * A number of logfetch issues have been addressed:
     - --debug syntax is now supported. (If modifying the command line in xymonclient.sh,
       use --debug=stderr to prevent spurious lines being sent in the client report.)
     - Invalid POSIX regular expressions for ignore or trigger lines will now be reported
       but should not cause crashes
     - Null characters in a log file will no longer cause further processing to stop (Thanks,
       Franco Gasperino.)
     - All lines matching a 'trigger' regex will be reported back, even if the total size
       exceeds the "maxbytes" limit. (Up to the maximum compiled buffer size.) As much of
       the final section as can be fit in the space remaining will be included, similar
       to the previous behavior if maxbytes was exceeded but no trigger lines were given.
       (Thanks, Franco Gasperino.)
     - The current location (where the previous run left off) is now marked in the status 
       report.
     - The '<...SKIPPED...>' and '<...CURRENT...>' texts can be overridden by specifying 
       values for LOGFETCHSKIPTEXT and LOGFETCHCURRENTTEXT in xymonclient.cfg
     - The "scrollback" (number of positions in previous "runs" back) that logfetch starts
       at can now be specified with the LOGFETCHSCROLLBACK variable, from 0 - 6 (the default)
   * "deltacount" can be used to count the number of lines matching a specific regex in 
     client-local.cfg, counting only since the last run. These will be shown on the trends page.
     NOTE: Unlike the "linecount:" option, deltacount is specified after a specific "log:" line.
     See the client-local.cfg file for details.
   * ifstat and netstat output from the new Windows PowerShell client is now graphed properly.
   * Hostnames beginning with a number (allowed by RFC1123) are now supported in combo.cfg
   * When a Windows service's status has been changed (ie, stopped or started), the relevant line
     in the 'svcs' test will now be updated to reflect this. (Reported by Gavin Stone-Tolcher and
     Neil Simmonds)
   * Various build issues, compiler fixes, and valgrind complaints have been fixed.

xymon (4.3.14) unstable; urgency=low

   * rev 7376
   * Fix critical ack not working for hosts where the display-name is
     set (via "NAME:" tag). From Any Smith.
   * SNI (Server Name Indication) causes some SSL connections to fail
     due to server-side buggy SSL implementations. Add "sni" and "nosni" 
     flags to control SNI for specific hosts, and "--sni" option for 
     xymonnet to control the default. Reported by Mark Felder.
   * Fix build process to fully obey any XYMONTOPDIR setting from the
     top-level Makefile. NOTE: Client-only builds no longer install the
     client in a "client/" subdirectory below XYMONHOME.
   * Fix showgraph so it silently ignores stale rrdctl files when trying
     to flush RRD data before showing a graph.
   * Fix xymond_alert crashing when trying to strip <cr> characters
     from the alert message. Bug introduced in 4.3.13.
   * Fix Solaris client to report memory even when no swap is configured.
   * Fix bug where alerts that were initially suppressed due to TIME
     restrictions are delayed until REPEAT interval expires.
   * Fix crash in xymonlaunch when trying to find tasks.cfg
   * Fix HTML generated by acknowledge.cgi (missing '>')
   * Fix Linux client reporting garbled client data if top output ends 
     without a new-line (causes CPU load and other vmstat graphs to
     stop updating)
   * Fix Debian installation so it enables Apache mod_rewrite
   * Fix merge-lines utility crashing when first line was an include
   * Fix "make install" failing when server/www/help was a symlink
   * Document existing OPTIONAL setting in analysis.cfg for file-checks 
     on files which may not exist.
   * Document existing CLASS setting in alerts.cfg
   * Add new INFOCOLUMNGIF and TRENDSCOLUMNGIF settings so the icons 
     used for these pages are configurable.
   * Enhance Solaris client to correctly handle Solaris zones.
   * Add new search facilities to xymond to select hosts with the
     'xymondboard' and 'hostinfo' commands.
   * New --ack-each-color option for xymondd changes ack behaviour so a 
     yellow ack does not apply when status changed to red, but a red ack 
     applies if status goes yellow
   * New "headermatch" tag for http tests so content checks can look at
     HTTP headers in addition to the HTML body.
   * Use system-wide c-ares library. NB: Now requires libc-ares2.

xymon (4.3.3) unstable; urgency=high

  rev 6684

    configurable. Also allow the header/footer for the Critical Systems 
    view to be configurable.
    Suggestion and preliminary patch from Buchan Milne.
  * xymonnet: Improve error report when HTTP tests get an empty response - 
    'HTTP error 0' sounds weird.
  * report / snapshot CGI's: Fix buffer overrun in the HTML delimiter 
    generated in the "please wait..." message. Also, fix potential buffer 
    overrun in report CGI if invoked with a large value for the "style" 
    parameter. 
    Reported by Rolf Biesbroek.
  * Graph definitions (graphs.cfg): Multi graphs cannot use a regex pattern. 
    Problem report by Brian Majeska
  * Solaris interface statistics: Filter out "mac" and "wrsmd" devices at
    the client side. 
    Update RRD handler to also filter "wrsmd" at the server side, like we 
    already did for "mac" devices. 
    Cf. http://www.xymon.com/archive/2009/06/msg00204.html
  * Documentation: Document the XMH_* fields available in xymondboard commands.
  * Documentation: Document SPLITNCV and "trends" methods of doing 
    custom graphs.
  * RRD definitions: Allow override of --step/-s option for rrdcreate, 
    from template supplied in rrddefinitions.cfg. 
    Suggestion from Brian Majeska.

  * Build procedure: Add notice about running upgrade script before 
    installing the new version.

    whether the recovery was due to the service actually recovering, or 
    if it was merely disabled.
  * xymond_alert: Fix missing element in array of alert status texts used 
    for tracing. 
    Spotted by Dominique Frise.
  * Add support for FreeBSD v8 modified ifstat output

xymon (4.3.0-0.20110120.rc1) unstable; urgency=low

  * 4.3.0 RC1 release - rev 6627

  * hosts.cfg badldap documentation: Document that for LDAP URL's you must use 'badldapurl'. Reported by Simo Hmami.
  * xymond flap detection: Make number of tracked status changes and the flap-check period configurable. Change the defaults to trigger flapping at more than 5 status changes in a 30 minute period.
  * sendmessage: Enhanced error reporting, to help track down communication problems.
  * xymond_client: Fix Windows SVC status handling to avoid coredumps, memory corruption and other nasties. 
    Will now report the real name of the service, instead of the pattern used in the analysis.cfg file.
    NOTE: Slight change to status message format.
  * Client handler: Fix owner/user check parsing. Reported by Ian Marsh http://www.xymon.com/archive/2011/01/msg00133.html (also broken in 4.2.3).

  * Xymongen: Fix documentation of the --doc-window/--no-doc-window options.
  * Webpage background: Use a CSS and a new set of gif's to implement a background that works on all displays, regardless of width. Uses a new xymonbody.css stylesheet which can also control some other aspects of the webpage. From Francois Claire.
  * Documentation: The xymon 'rename' command should be used AFTER renaming a host in hosts.cfg, not before. From Tom Georgoulias.
  * Memory status: Add some sanity checks for the memory utilisation reported by clients. Occasionally we get completely bogus data from clients, so only act on them if percentages do not exceed 100.
  * Critical systems view: Add "--tooltips" option so you can save screen space by hiding the host descriptions in a tooltip, like we do on the statically generated pages. Feature request from Chris Morris.
  * Solaris client: Report "swap -l" in addition to "swap -s" for swap usage. Backend prefers output from "swap -l" when determining swap utilisation.
  * Webpage menu: Use the CSS and GIF's by Malcolm Hunter - they are much nicer than the ones from Debian. Distribute both the blue and the grey version, and configure which one to use in xymonserver.cfg.

  * xymonproxy: Fix broken compatibility option '--bbdisplay'
  * Fix eventlog summary/count enums so they dont clash with Solaris predefined entities

  * Historical statuslog display: Work-around for crash when status-log is empty
  * fping.sh configure sub-script: Fix syntax error in suggested 'sudoers' configuration, and point to the found fping binary. From Steff Coene.
  * namematch routine: Fix broken matching when doing simple matching against two strings where one was a subset of the other. http://www.xymon.com/archive/2010/11/msg00177.html .  Reported by Elmar Heeb who also provided a patch, although I chose a different solution to this.
  * Xymon net: Fix broken compile when LDAP-checks are disabled. Reported by Roland Soderstrom, fix from Ralph Mitchell.
  * xymon(7) manpage: Drop notice that renaming in 4.3.0 is not complete
  * Installation: Setup links for the commonly used Hobbit binaries (bb, bbcmd, bbdigest, bbhostgrep, bbhostshow)
  * Upgrade script: Setup symlinks for the old names of the standard webpages
  * xymonserver.cfg.DIST: Missing end-quote in compatibility BBSERVERSECURECGIURL setting. From Ralph Mitchell

hobbit (4.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Xymon version 4.2.3 release
  * Time-out code changed to use clock_gettime() with CLOCK_MONOTONIC
  * Bugfix for hobbitd/hobbitd_worker communication going out-of-sync
    resulting in "garbled data" being logged and worker modules 
    stopping.
  * NCV module now works with negative numbers.
  * Several bugfixes in DNS lookup code - could lead to crashes when
    performing DNS tests.
  * Switch to C-ARES 1.6.0 - drop support for older versions.
  * Run more TCP tests in parallel by not waiting for very slow
    connections to complete before starting new ones.
  * Added "hostlist" web utility for spreadsheet-reporting of the
    hosts in Hobbit.
